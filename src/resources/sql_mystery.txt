14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z".
Only gold members have those bags.
The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

Joe does not drive and has no official income, Jeremy drives but has little income

SELECT * FROM interview i

67318	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money.
I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67").
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S.
I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
